    <h1> Welcom to Bangladesh </h1>

    <p> Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian country marked by lush greenery and many
        waterways. Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and travel by boat is common. On
        the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an enormous mangrove forest shared with Eastern India, is home to the royal
        Bengal tiger. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"> Learn more</a> </p>

        <h1 class="Barishal"> <strong> Barishal Division </strong>


            <p>Barisal Division is one of the eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh. Located in the south-central
                part of the country, it has an area of 13,644.85 km2 (5,268.31 sq mi), and a population of 9,100,102 at
                the
                2011 Census. It is the least populous Division within the entirety of Bangladesh. Barisal was conquered
                by
                Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji and was later a significant territory of the Delhi Sultanate and Bengal
                Sultanate. After the decline of the Suri Empire, the territory became a semi-independent area in the
                Mughal
                period because of heavy fighting between the Muslims and Hindu chiefs, although most parts of the city
                were
                totally under the control of the governors of the proto-industrialised Bengal Subah. In course of time,
                it
                fell under the Bengal Nawabs. Raja Ramranjan Chakravarty was put as a de jure king during the Bengal
                Presidency of the British, later passed to East Pakistan at independence and finally Bangladesh.

            <p class="Chi">Chittagong Division, officially known as Chattogram Division, is geographically the largest
                of the eight
                administrative divisions of Bangladesh. It covers the south-easternmost areas of the country, with a
                total
                area of 34,529.97 km2 (13,332.10 sq mi) and a population at the 2022 census of 33,202,326. The
                administrative division includes mainland Chittagong District, neighbouring districts and the Chittagong
                Hill Tracts.

                Chittagong Division is home to Cox's Bazar, the longest natural sea beach in the world as well as St.
                Martin's Island, Bangladesh's sole coral reef.

                The Chittagong Division was established in 1829 to serve as the administrative headquarters of the three
                eastern districts of Bengal's and the two districts of Chittagong's, with the Chittagong District
                serving as

            <p class="Dha">Dhaka Division is an administrative division within
                Bangladesh. Dhaka
                serves as the capital city of the Dhaka Division, the Dhaka District and Bangladesh. The division
                remains a
                population magnet, covers an area of 20,508.8 km2 with a population in excess of 44 million, growing at
                1.94% rate since prior count, compared with national average of 1.22%. However, national figures may
                include
                data skewing expatriation of male labor force as gender ratio is skewed towards females.

                Dhaka Division borders every other division in the country except Rangpur Division. It is bounded by
                Mymensingh Division to the north, Barisal Division to the south, Chittagong Division to the east and
                south-east, Sylhet Division to the north-east, and Rajshahi Division to the west and Khulna Divisions to
                the
                south-west.

                Dhaka Division consisted before 2015 of four city corporations, 13 districts, 123 upazilas and 1,248
                union
                parishads. However, four of the most northerly of the 17 districts were removed in 2015 to create the
                new
                Mymensingh Division, and another five districts (those situated to the south of the Ganges/Padma River)
                are

        <h1 class="KH"> <Strong> Khulna Division </Strong>
            <p class="KH-1">
                <strong>Khulna</strong> is the third-largest city in Bangladesh, after Dhaka and Chittagong. It is the
                administrative centre of Khulna District and Khulna Division. Khulna's economy is the third-largest in
                Bangladesh, contributing $53 billion in gross state product and $95 billion in purchasing power parity
                (PPP) in 2020. In the 2022 census, the city had a population of 718,735.Khulna is on the Rupsha and
                Bhairab Rivers. A center of Bangladeshi industry, the city hosts many national companies. It is served
                by the Port of Mongla, Bangladesh's second-largest seaport. Khulna River Port is one of the country's
                oldest and busiest river ports. A colonial steamboat service, which includes the Tern, Osrich and
                Lepcha, operates on the river route to the city. Khulna is considered the gateway to the Sundarbans, the
                world's largest mangrove forest and home of the Bengal tiger. <br> <br>

                Khulna was part of the ancient kingdoms of Vanga and Samatata. It became a part of the Sena dynasty
                during the 12th-century reign of Ballala Sena, and formed part of the Bagri division of Bengal. During
                the 14th century, Shamsuddin Firoz Shah was the first Muslim ruler to arrive in the city. Muslim
                settlements increased during the time of Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, and many mosques and shrines were
                established. A Muslim saint, Khan Jahan Ali, acquired a jagir (fiefdom) encompassing a large part of
                Khulna Division from the king of Gauḍa during the 15th century and renamed the region as Jahanabad. Ali
                ruled until he died in 1459. <br> <br>

                After Ali's death, the city became part of the Bengal Sultanate. During the reign of Daud Khan Karrani
                in the 16th century, Vikramaditya (one of Karrani's chief ministers) obtained a grant in southern
                Bengal—including Khulna—when Karrani was fighting the Mughals. Vikramaditya established a sovereign
                kingdom with its capital at Iswaripur (in present-day Satkhira District). He was succeeded by his son,
                Pratapaditya, who gained preeminence over the Baro-Bhuyans and controlled southern Bengal. Vikramaditya
                was defeated by Raja Man Singh I, a Hindu Rajput general of the Mughal emperor Akbar, in 1611. <br> <br>

                Khulna was ruled by autonomous Bengali nawabs until 1793 when the British East India Company abolished
                nizamat (local rule) and took control of the city. Becoming part of Jessore District in 1842, it became
                the headquarters of Khulna District (the Khulna and Bagerhat subdivisions of Jessore District, the
                Satkhira subdivision of 24 Parganas district, and the Sundarbans) in 1882. Khulna had a pouroshava
                (municipal council) in 1884, which became a municipal corporation in 1984. <br> <br>

                Before 19 August 1947, Khulna District was part of undivided Bengal. Khulna first declared itself as
                part of India in 1947, and the Indian flag was flown on 15 August. Syed Mohammad Abdul Halim (an
                official of the Bengali civil service) requested Khulna's inclusion in Pakistan, and the boundary
                commission declared that the city was part of East Bengal. Sher e Bangla A.K.Fazlul Haq, Muslim League
                leaders Khan A Sabur, Advocate Hamidul Haq Chowdhury, A. F. M. Abdul Jalil, and Abdul Mojid Khan were
                also involved in the process.

        <h1 class="MY-1"> Mymensingh Division

            <p class="MY-2">
                Mymensingh Division is one of the eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh. It has an area of 10,485
                square kilometres (4,048 sq mi) and a population of 12,225,498 as of the 2022 census. It was formed in
                2015 from districts previously composing the northern part of Dhaka Division. Its headquarters are in
                Mymensingh city in Mymensingh District. <br> <br>

                The city was constituted by the British East India Company on 1 May 1787. Mymensingh is the 8th
                administrative divisional headquarter and 12th city corporation of Bangladesh. According to Ministry of
                Public Administration, Mymensingh is ranked 4th in district status. The population density of Mymensingh
                city is 44,458/km2 (115,150/sq mi), making it the second most densely populated city in Bangladesh.
                Mymensingh attracts 25 percent of all the health tourists visiting Bangladesh. Mymensingh is an
                anglicisation of the name Momen Singh, referring to a Muslim ruler called Shah Momin or Momin Singh, an
                ethnic Bengali Muslim ruler. Its elevation is over 19 m above sea level, the highest of Bangladesh's
                major cities.[4] Mymensingh is close to Tura, a city in Meghalaya from the Gobrakura Land Port. <br><br>

                Mymensingh is one of the sixteen old districts of Bangladesh which was constituted by the British East
                India Company on 1 May 1787. Being more than 220 years old, Mymensingh has a rich cultural and political
                history. In the beginning, Begunbari was chosen as the headquarters of the district. However, the
                district headquarters was relocated to Mymensingh when Begunbari devastated by a flash flood.[citation
                needed] Earlier Mymensingh was called Nasirabad, after Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah. During the British Raj
                most of the inhabitants of the town were Hindus.[citation needed] During the British, this district was
                ruled by Banik Zamindars who moved to India during Partition. <br> <br>

                From the early 20th century Muslims moved into town. Since then this city has played an important role
                as a centre for secularism. The Vidyamoyee Uccha Balika Bidyalaya and Muminunnesa Women's College have
                played a great role in educating Bengali Muslim women. A majority of first-generation successful
                Bangladeshi women have attended these schools and colleges, including the first woman justice of the
                High Court of Bangladesh, Justice Nazmun Ara Sultana. However, many Hindu families left Bangladesh
                during the partition of India in 1947. A second spell of Exodus took place following the Indo-Pak war of
                1965. Many people born and raised Mymensingh have left for West Bengal since the 1960s. The exodus
                continues albeit at a slower pace. On 1 December 1969, Tangail subdivision was separated from Mymensingh
                and a new District of Tangail was formed. Then in 1977 another new district Jamalpur (including Sherpur)
                was formed. <br> <br>

                The nine-month liberation war of Bangladesh started on 27 March 1971. Mymensingh remained free from the
                occupation army until 23 April 1971. Pakistani occupation forces deserted Mymensingh on 10 December, and
                Mukti Bahini took over on 11 December, just five days ahead of the victory of Dhaka on 16 December.

                located 14 kilometres (9 mi) to the west of Rajshahi town. Rajshahi was dominated by various Maharajas,
                Rajas and Zamindars.During Deo Raja's period, the region was known as Mohakalgarh. In 1288-89 the Raja
                was defeated by Shah Makhdum Rupos. The region came to be known as "Rampur Boalia" after the
                establishment of an administrative office in 1825. The origin of the present name of "Rajshahi" is
                debated among scholars. Most say that it takes its name from Hindu Kings Rajshahi Raj (or "Rajas") as
                Raj and the persianised Shahi; both of which mean "royal" or "kingdom". he administrative district was
                established in 1772 and the municipal corporation in 1876. <br><br>
